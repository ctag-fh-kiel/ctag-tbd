// this is an arena style allocator for the sound processors
// implemented to reduce memory fragmentation
// steps to use:
// 1. call AllocateInternalBuffer with size of large buffer at program start
// 2. call PrepareAllocation with specific AllocationType before creating new sound processor,
// note that the state is set in "allocationType" for subsequent allocations
// 3. Allocate is called in overloaded new operator of sound processor
// 4. GetRemainingBufferSize is called by sound processor factory in "Init()" to pass remaining memory size available to sound processor
// 5. GetRemainingBuffer is called by sound processor factory in "Init()" to pass remaining memory available to sound processor
// 6. ReleaseInternalBuffer is called at program end to release large buffer, or when large memory is needed somewhere else
