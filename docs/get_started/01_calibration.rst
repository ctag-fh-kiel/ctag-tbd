Calibration Procedure
*********************

Preparation
===========

Make sure you have a well calibrated 1V/Octave CV keyboard available
0V corresponds to C0
2.5V corresponds approx. to F#2
5V corresponds to C5
-5V may not be achieved, in this case your TBD cannot be calibrated for bi-polar CV use
Or have a CV generator available which can be adjusted to precise voltages
Elektron Analog 4 or ornament and crime work well for this purpose
An adjustable lab voltage source together with a precise multimeter does the trick as well
Allow for TBD two CV ins to be connected at the same time to the calibration voltage source

Procedure
=========

In the main menu, hit the “Edit configuration” button to enter the configuration tab
Hit the “Reboot, calibrate CVs” button → TBD will reboot in calibration mode, the LED blinks red
Turn CV pots all left, apply 0V to CV in jacks → single press trig0
Turn CV pots mid position, apply 2.5V to CV jacks → single press trig0
Turn CV pots all right, apply 5V to CV jacks → single press trig0
Turn CV pots all left, apply -5V to CV in jacks → single press trig0
Turn CV pots mid position, apply 0V to CV in jacks → single press trig0
Turn CV pots all right, apply 5V to CV in jacks → single press trig0
TBD is now calibrated and will reboot to operating mode

Backup / Restore
================

You can backup and restore your calibration data e.g. prior to a fresh calibration or system update by hitting the “Calibration Backup” in the Configuration page. A new page will pop up, here you can down/upload calibration data (JSON format).
