************************
Building TBD from Source
************************

Depending on the part of TBD you want to build, you will need a multitude of different tools.
It is strongly advised to use an IDE that supports *dev containers* such as *Visual Studio Code*
or *CLion*, to avoid polluting your system. Use the ``.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`` file
or click on your IDE's hint, when it detects the file.
