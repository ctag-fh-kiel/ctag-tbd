Overview

TBD is a highly flexible system organised in components, that allows adding features, adapting the firmware to different
hardware and use cases and contributing to the project in all kinds of ways. Depending on your interests there are
different aspects of the system of interest, requiring different skill levels

Hardware Developers [basic]
    Understanding an editing firmware config YAML files to configure pinouts and add/swap components matching the
    hardware. Adding ESPHome actions to add custom business logic and make components interact.

Audio Enthusiast [basic]
    Writing sound processing functions for custom audio plugins to add your own sound plugins. Mathematically generate
    output samples from plugin parameters and input audio samples.

Subsystem Developers [expert]
    Create componentes that provide features for other componentes, providing python helpers, utilizing the power of
    the build and generation system and the build stage mechanics.

Build System Developers [advanced expert]
    Add features to the build generators and reflection processors themselves (requires deeper understanding of the
    build system itself).
