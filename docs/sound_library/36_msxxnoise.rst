MSxxNoise (Mono)

**Description**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Please be careful when using high resonance-levels of the filter,
especially in combination with a higher filter-drive. The sound can get
quite loud and nasty.**

| Here is a little demo-track done with MSxxNoise with reverb added in
  the DAW:
| https://soundcloud.com/taitekatto/msxxnoise-for-tbd

| MSxxNoise uses a filter design modeled after the Sallen Key Filter as
  used with the Korg 35 chip of the early Korg PS3100/PS3200/3300 or
  MS10/MS20/MS50, hence the name of the plugin. Later Korg replaced the
  design with minor changes in sound, but that’s yet another story.
| The second main building block of this TBD plugin is a phaser which is
  modelled after the Electro Harmonix small stone.
| These two modifiers can be used alone or in combination with the
  internally provided noise or any external signal. In addition, filter
  modulation can be added. As with many Korg instruments the LFO is
  called MG (Modulation Generator) instead.

.. _usage-patch-ideas-6:

**Usage / Patch Ideas**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normally the patches will be driven by MSxxNoise’s main building
blocks:

-  External Input

-  Noise Generator (Pink/White)

-  Filter (Including Drive)

-  Filter Modulation Generator

-  Phaser

The Filter and the Phaser can be completely disabled.
Patches can be derived by applying the filter in combination with
filter-modulation and the phaser, the filter alone, the phaser alone on
external input or the internal noise. It even can make sense to use the
external input alone with the built in noise-sources. As always please
feel free to experiment!
