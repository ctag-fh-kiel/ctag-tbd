Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

A generator for audio artefacts known from record players and
tapes. Can be used as a stand-alone generator or effect applied to audio
input material (real-time from either of TBDâ€™s audio inputs).

Features of Antique include:

- Input distortion and re-pitching

-  Hiss noise (level, shape, frequency, bandwidth), typically due
    to noisy analog components

-  Scrub noise (level, frequency, bandwidth, speed), typically
      due to mechanical sliding of pickup system, is synced to wow
      frequency

-  Hum noise (level, shape, frequency, aggression), typically
      50/60Hz harmonic line noise

-  Wow (level, speed), lower frequency pitch variations due to
      e.g. mis-centered record hole

-  Flutter (level, speed), higher frequency pitch variations due
      to driver imperfections

-  Click noise (level, density, frequency and modulation), click
      noises e.g. due to dust on the record, non-repeating patterns

-  Pop noise (level, density, frequency, length), lower frequency
      pops due to damages of record material, 2 patterns are
      cross-faded, each with variable density, pattern length can be
      synced to wow frequency to imitate rotating record

-  Output EQ, efx routing and dry/wet mix
