Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

Dub-like minor pads or smooth long attack / release glue logic
strings, this plugin provides a whopping 24 voice polyphony at the tip
of a finger press. The base waveform comes from a super saw oscillator,
with adjustable detune fed through a state variable filter (SVF). Chord
harmonies can be chosen from 18 presets, including inversions. Each
chord consists of max. 4 notes, which are fed through an ADSR envelope
generator (EG). The EG can be mapped onto the SVF for filter modulation.
Each chord can be held whilst a new chord is triggered. Once the max.
polyphony is reached the most silent chord will be killed. Full pad
power with just one trigger / CV from just one TBD plugin. Two
additional LFOs can modulate filter cutoff and oscillator frequency to
create vibratos.
