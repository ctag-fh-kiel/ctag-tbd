## Documentation (in the works):
Documentation on TBD usage can be found [here (Google Docs)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c8mjxWjdiJNP0xpkU2CxRUp9av6V4W39wARJf3_SMSo/edit?usp=sharing)
Tutorial videos in [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB5iCbhcvJ2qdD7s1o9wsvQ9qtsCUWVLR)

## Update procedure
Easiest way to update is to use the ready made [releases from github](https://github.com/ctag-fh-kiel/ctag-tbd/releases).
Flash the ctag-tbd.bin and storage.bin from the TBD web ui (within the configuration menu).
Alternatively you can connect a USB cable to the TBD and use the serial flasher from esp idf (see how to flash below).
In order to use the sample rom, you can upload from the edit sample rom page [factory sample data](sample_rom/readme.md) (sample-rom.tbd).

## What it is:
- The eierlegende Wollmilchsau (German for swiss army) audio processing module.
- Offering already more than 30 high quality audio generators and effects.
- Open source Eurorack sound module based on the ESP32.
- With an easy to extend audio plugin architecture.
- What you make it.

## Why it is:
- A group of audio enthusiasts enjoying coding and hardware making.
- Build a platform to learn, build and practise skills, and engage students.
- To allow anyone to understand technology by offering open access.
- To squeeze and optimize code so that it can work on a small embedded system.
- Because we can.
- To fight boredom and despair of Corona Virus!

## Features: 
- More than 30 high quality audio generators and effects.
- Easy DSP plugin development.
- **NEW!!!** Sample ROM playback and wavetable oscillator with user wavetables from sample ROM [details here](sample_rom/readme.md)
- **NEW!!!** Simulator for cross platform plugin development without hardware module (speeds up plugin development, better code verification).
    - Check description [here](simulator/readme.md)
- With web UI user interface by wireless browser access.
- Through a REST-API.

## Version log
[See here...](versions.md)

## Potential new features / current limitations / work to be done:
- More plugins.
- VULT support.
- Bug identification and fixing.
- Code refactoring to make things more beautiful.
- More user friendly interaction.
- Documentation / tutorials.
- Your ideas?

## How to engage yourself:
- Join the [enthusiastic developer](https://codewithoutrules.com/2018/11/12/enthusiasts-vs-pragmatists/) team on Github.
- Help build and spread the hardware module (and the word).
- Help documenting.
- More ideas?

## How to build
You need C/C++ skills. You may want to check the [TBD simulator](simulator/readme.md) for easy plugin development without TBD hardware.

**NEW!!!** you can build the firmware using a Github action. Just fork the ctag-tbd repo to your Github account and enable the supplied
Github action. Each time you will push your edits into your fork's master branch, Github will cut a draft release for you automatically.
No need for a toolchain on your own system.

If you prefer to have a dev environment on your own, install espressif esp-idf, instructions are [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/index.html).
Use git to checkout esp-idf release/v4.1 (TBD may build also with newer versions, you can try), do this within the esp-idf folder:
```sh
git checkout release/v4.1
git submodule update
sudo ./install.sh
```
You may need to upgrade CMake to version 3.16 or higher.
Then follow these steps to create the firmware image:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ctag-fh-kiel/ctag-tbd.git
cd ctag-tbd
git submodule update --init --recursive
idf.py build
```

### tbd cloud compiler
The [tbd cloud compiler](https://fxwiegand.github.io/tbd-cloud-compiler/) allows you to reduce the size of the ctag-tbd firmware, therefore making up more free space for your samples, by removing one or multiple plug-ins that you don't want to use with your module. For more information take a look at the [user guide](https://fxwiegand.github.io/tbd-cloud-compiler/user-guide).

## How to flash
Either use the binaries available from the [releases at github](https://github.com/ctag-fh-kiel/ctag-tbd/releases) to flash through the TBD's web ui. 

Or use [ESP Tool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) to flash through a USB connection with your PC (check [this script](bin/flash.sh)).

If you have [ESP IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) installed (the whole development environment), use:
```sh
idf.py flash monitor
```
