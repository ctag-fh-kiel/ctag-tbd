## Documentation (in the works) / wishlist:
Documentation on TBD usage can be found [here (Google Docs)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c8mjxWjdiJNP0xpkU2CxRUp9av6V4W39wARJf3_SMSo/edit?usp=sharing)

## What it is:
- An open source Eurorack sound module based on the ESP32.
- With an easy to extend audio plugin architecture.
- What you make it.

## Why it is:
- A group of audio enthusiasts enjoying coding and hardware making.
- Build a platform to learn, build and practise skills, and engage students.
- To allow anyone to understand technology by offering open access.
- To squeeze and optimize code so that it can work on a small embedded system.
- Because we can.
- To fight boredom and despair of Corona Virus!

## Features: 
- Easy DSP plugin development.
- **NEW!!!** Simulator for cross platform plugin development without hardware module (speeds up plugin development, better code verification).
    - Check description [here](simulator/readme.md)
- With web UI user interface by wireless browser access.
- Through a REST-API.

## Potential new features / current limitations / work to be done:
- FAUST support.
- Bug identification and fixing.
- Code refactoring to make things more beautiful.
- More user friendly interaction.
- Documentation / tutorials.
- Your ideas?

## How to engage yourself:
- Join the [enthusiastic developer](https://codewithoutrules.com/2018/11/12/enthusiasts-vs-pragmatists/) team on Github.
- Help build and spread the hardware module (and the word).
- Help documenting.
- More ideas?
